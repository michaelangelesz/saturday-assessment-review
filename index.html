    <p>The centuries old vampire Count Dracula comes to England to seduce his barrister Jonathan Harker's fianc√©e Mina Murray and inflict havoc in the foreign land.</p>
    
  
    <h4>Intersting facts!</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Producer and director Francis Ford Coppola explains on the DVD commentary that Mina and Harker's wedding was a re-shoot done at a Los Angeles Greek Orthodox church. They filmed the entire ceremony with a genuine Romanian Orthodox minister, and realized afterwards that Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves may have really been married to each other, not in any legal sense, but "under the eyes of God" as Ryder claims. Reeves has since confessed that he often gets text messages from Ryder that read "Hello, husband", and that they are both completely fine with it.</li>
        <li>Prince Vlad's scream after he drives his sword into the cross is not the voice of Gary Oldman. Lux Interior, lead singer of punk band The Cramps, recorded the scream, and it was dubbed in.</li>
        <li>Gary Oldman said that when he first read the script, he decided it would be worth doing the movie just so he could feel what it would be like to say, "I've crossed oceans of time to find you" to someone.</li>
